# Hyper Clicker

This is a lightweight (6.18 MB) modern and cool looking auto clicker written with Tauri. 

(Also, this is my first project in entire life, so the code is most likely complete crap, but it works so... yeah)

# Help Me

There are some problems with hotkeys related to Tauri API (or I just havenâ€™t found how to fix it). If you know how to use Virtual key codes, then I will be glad if you can help me fix them!
